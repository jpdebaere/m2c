Modula-2 to C Translator and Compiler

M2C is a multi-dialect Modula-2 to C translator and via-C compiler. It supports the dialects described in the 3rd and 4th editions of Niklaus Wirth's book "Programming in Modula-2" (PIM) published by Springer Verlag, and an extended mode with select features from the revised language by B.Kowarsch and R.Sutcliffe "Modula-2 Revision 2010" (M2R10).

In translator mode, M2C translates Modula-2 source to C source files. In compiler mode, M2C compiles Modula-2 source via C source files to object code or executables using the host system's C compiler.

PIM dialects are supported to allow compilation of program examples from Modula-2 literature which is largely based on PIM. Extended mode is supported to facilitate bootstrapping of a full implementation of M2R10 targeting the CLR.
